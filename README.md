## TornadoFx Multi-Project Template

Just a simple template created by modifying the   
`❯ gradle init`  
output project (the Kotlin "Application" Multi-Project version).

> app Holds the main tornadofx app.
> utilities Holds any all-purpose or general utility classes/functions
> list This sub-project is a carry-over from the gradle init template. Needs to be exchanged for something more realistic? Maybe a collection of custom Tornadofx components / controls?
